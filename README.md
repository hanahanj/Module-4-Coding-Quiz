# Coding-Quiz
Bootcamp Module 4 Challange 


This application is intended to quiz someone on aspects of coding. It is currently partly functioning. I need to return to fix some issues with its structure that seem to be getting in the way of final funtionality including displaying score, randomizing location of answers, saving score, etc. 

I will be resubmitting this in the future.
