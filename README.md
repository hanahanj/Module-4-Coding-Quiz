# Coding-Quiz
Bootcamp Module 4 Challange 

## Description
This application is intended to quiz someone on aspects of coding. 

## User Story 

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Criteria

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and score



## Status
It is currently partly functioning. I need to return to fix some issues with its structure that seem to be getting in the way of final funtionality including displaying score, randomizing location of answers, saving score, etc.
